```

## Introduction 

This is an R Markdown based document for presenting the project results. The main target of the project is to build a predictive model. 

### Uploading the data

```{r}
ffp <- read.csv("ffp_train.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
